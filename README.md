## Quick Start

### 1. Fork This Repository

**Important**: This repository contains configurations specific to my home setup. Please fork this repository and customize it for your own environment rather than using it directly.

### 2. Use a Device Template

Pick the template for your specific device and start from that file:

```yaml
# Example: guition-esp32-s3-4848s040/esphome/template.yaml
substitutions:
  name: "your-device-name"
  friendly_name: "Your Room Sensor"
  room: "Your Room"
```

### 3. Update WiFi and Secrets

Set your WiFi credentials in the Esphome secrets file:

```yaml
wifi_ssid: "Your_WiFi_SSID"
wifi_password: "Your_WiFi_Password"
```

### 4. Customize for Your Setup

Each template pulls in modular components that you can customize:

- **Device Configuration**: `device/device.yaml`
- **Sensors**: `device/sensors.yaml`
- **LVGL Interface**: `device/lvgl.yaml`
- **Add-ons**: Time, backlight, and network configurations in `addon/`
- **Assets**: Custom fonts and icons in `assets/`
- **Theme**: Button styling and UI components in `theme/`

## Getting Started with ESPHome

1. **Install ESPHome**: Follow the [ESPHome installation guide] (https://esphome.io/guides/installing_esphome.html)

2. **Copy the repo**: Use the device template in `*/esphome/` as your starting configuration

3. **Customize**: Update the substitutions and modify components as needed for your specific setup

4. **Flash**: Compile and flash to your ESP32 device

## Home Assistant Stateful Scenes

The lighting scene examples in this project assume you are using the Stateful Scenes integration for Home Assistant so scene state can be inferred reliably (for example, keeping a scene switch "on" when all scene entities match). Install and configure the add-on here: https://github.com/hugobloem/stateful_scenes.
